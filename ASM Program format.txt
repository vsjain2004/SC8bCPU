1. Upto 16 lines of Assembly instructions, with final instruction being "END". Labels can be used for memory address
   reference as "X: Y", where X is the Label and Y is the instruction.
2. A 1 Line empty space
3. Data Memory with each address on new line set as "X: Y", where X is an identifier variable/Label, used in the instructions as 
   well, and Y is the data.

Number Format: For any Signed Immediate operand, shift amount, and Data Memory, use the following:
    #  : Decimal (#-128 to #127)
    #B : Binary (#B00000000 to #B11111111)

For any memory address for jump/branch instructions, it is recommended to use Labels and use them at said instruction.
